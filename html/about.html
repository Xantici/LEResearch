      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <div>
        We believe that lived experience means expert by experience, and we welcome the increase in meaningful participant involvement. We recognise the valuable research many researchers who aren't marginalised make, and we would welcome your involvement in taking part in the studies we list. We would like to help draw attention to the research by people who are researching a marginalisation they themselves experience because this adds another dimension in developing research valuable to those communities, and it allows for greater understanding of the cultures of those communities. Research can be insensitive, or harmful, and by having researchers in those rooms who have lived experience, we hope that that can be minimised by contributions to discussions and decision making. Marginalised researchers are also likely to have less energy (or spoons) than their counterparts and may therefore struggle to recruit as effectively, or have less time left to recruit due to other delays, especially if this relies on pushing adverts on social media themselves. This is potentially a barrier to career progression/ PhD completion which may lead to fewer people with lived experience in those roles.
